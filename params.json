  "body": "### Get your theory on.\r\nHarmonic theory is all fancy-like, but don't trip - [here is some software](/kord-box/app) to do the boring math for you as you explore chord voicings.  Don't know what you're doing?  It's all good - just press the buttons, and you can do no wrong.  The grid's got you in key.  If you're on a keyboard-having device, use they keys 1-8 to audition the chords you've made.\r\n\r\n### Wait, what about minor harmony?\r\nSo complicated right?  Not really - switch scales using the buttons atop each column.  Keep switching to toggle through available scales.  Drop into harmonic minor to slap folks with that V chord.  Mix major and minor scales to create tension and pull on people's ear-holes.\r\n\r\n### Yes, this is very awesome.\r\nRight?  When you're feeling it, export to MIDI and load up into your trusty sequencer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# [Launch kord-box](/kord-box/app)\r\n\r\n### Snap, it doesn't work on (whatever)\r\nYeah? Kord-box has been tested on Chrome and Firefox, which have legit web audio API support, and the desktop and mobile versions Safari, which have decent but not great support.  Touch devices should also work.  If you're using IE then you're probably used to the internet generally being a party that you didn't get invited to.  But if something's broken, [report an issue](https://github.com/dust4ngel/kord-box/issues).",
