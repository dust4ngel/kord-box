Don't know what you're doing?  It's all good - just press the buttons, and you can do no wrong.\r\n\r\n### W8 wot about minor harmony?\r\nSo complicated right?  Not really - switch scales using the buttons atop each column.  Drop into harmonic minor to slap folks with that V chord.  Mix major and minor scales to pull on people's ear-holes.\r\n\r\n### Yes, this is very awesome.\r\nRight?  When you're feeling it, export to MIDI and load up into your trusty sequencer.",
