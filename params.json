Don't know what you're doing?  It's all good - just press the buttons, and you can do no wrong.  The grid's got you in key.\r\n\r\n### Wait, what about minor harmony?\r\nSo complicated right?  Not really - switch scales using the buttons atop each column.  Keep switching to toggle through available scales.  Drop into harmonic minor to slap folks with that V chord.  Mix major and minor scales to create tension and pull on people's ear-holes.\r\n\r\n### Yes, this is very awesome.\r\nRight?  When you're feeling it, export to MIDI and load up into your trusty sequencer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# [Launch kord-box](/kord-box/app)\r\n\r\n### Snap, it doesn't work on (whatever)\r\nYeah, Safari and IE are dragging their feet on Web Audio API support.  Try Firefox or Chrome!",
